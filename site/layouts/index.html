   <h2>Question 2</h2>
   <p>My favorite thing about providing technical support is that you are helping people out with their frustrations.</p>
   
   <h2>Question 3</h2>
   <p>I don't like it because it is way too confusing and not simple for the average user. I spent too much time trying to figure out how to get the site generation tools that I installed working. It didn't help though that I didn't bother looking for instructions.</p>
   
   <h2>Question 4</h2>
   <p>I created a blank white page. I chose Hugo because it seemed to be the easiest one to get working. The challenges I had was getting the tool installed and figuring out how to edit the site. To get mine working, I clicked the name and saw the one click deploy to Netlify button. After clicking that button and waiting for it to install, I looked at the Hugo github to become familiar with the file structure. Once I found where the index page was, I went to the index page and started making edits.</p>

   <h2>Question 5</h2>
   <p>To improve this test, I think you should give a page to go to for reference/instructions on how do to something. This may or may not be asking too much, since being a Support Engineer, you are required to problem solve projects/technologies that you may or may not have seen before.</p>
   
   <h2>Question 6</h2>
   <h3>https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/documentation/</h3>
   <p>I think it is well done because: it's organized, has videos, and easy step-by-step instructions on how to do something.</p>
   
   <h2>Question 7</h2>
   <p>I think SSL is important because it secures the site and help's prevent hackers from stealing any data that someone enters into a form.</p>
   
   <h2>Question 8</h2>
   <p>DNS configuriation can be very confusiong for anyone that is not tech savvy. I think the two major challenges for DNS configuration for less-technical internet users is the setup and timing.</p>
   <p>Setting up the DNS configuration can be difficult, if you don't know what you are doing. The setup is difficult because their is different settings you have to do for different things. For example, if I'm not mistaken, I think you have to put a *, if you want something forwarded to another domain, whereas if you were just pointing a domain to server, you just put the ip or domain names in the DNS settings area. If the person has the domain at one page and the hosting at another place, that adds on to how complexity of doing something relatively simple. </p>
   <p>The second challenging thing for setting up a DNS configuration is time. A less-technical internet end user may think once it is set, it would work, which tech savvy people know about the 24 to 48 hour rule. Not knowing that rule, would cause someone that doesn't know that rule to freak out and keep messing with it.</p>
   
   <h2>Question 9</h2>
   <p>Sorry that you experiencing that issue. Without knowing more, it is hard to pin point on exactly why your site is not building. Some of the issues that may cause it is: not connected or installation.</p>
   <p>Please check the following things to see if one or more of these things fixes your issue. Your Netlify site may not be correctly connected to your Github account. Please go in your Netlify account and click the repository link to see if it connected to your Github account. If that doesn't work, please check to see if the site generation tool you used has completed installing.</p>
   <p>If none of those work, please reply back with more detail of what your setup is (site generation tool using, using a theme, etc.).</p>
